# Intro

JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

## undeclared variables

When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of undefined
