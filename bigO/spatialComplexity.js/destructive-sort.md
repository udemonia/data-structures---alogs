# Destructive

A sorting algorithm is destructive if it acts on its self - as opposed to a copy

If we wanted to keep a copy, we'd have to make a copy before hand - some sorting algorithms return a new array while leaving the array in tact

Again, there is a trade off - RAM, Computational Complexity, Destructive, Stable, etc. that we need to take stock of
