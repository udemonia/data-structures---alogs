# Spatial Complexity

In general, when someone talks about BigO without specifying, they're referring to computational complexity; i.e. how long does something take to run... or more how does the input impact how long something takes to run

There is also _spatial complexity_ - how much RAM or disk space does an algorithm need in order to run?
